In the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the choice of distance metric is crucial because it determines how the similarity or distance between data points is calculated. The most commonly used distance metrics in KNN are:

1. **Euclidean Distance:**
   - Euclidean distance is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. It's the most widely used distance metric in KNN.
   - Formula for Euclidean distance between two points, A(x1, y1, z1, ...) and B(x2, y2, z2, ...), in n-dimensional space:
    ``
     \[
     \text{Euclidean Distance (L2 Norm)} = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2 + \ldots}
     \]
     ``
2. **Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm):**
   - Manhattan distance, also known as the L1 norm or city block distance, measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates.
   - Formula for Manhattan distance between two points, A(x1, y1, z1, ...) and B(x2, y2, z2, ...), in n-dimensional space:
   ``
     \[
     \text{Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm)} = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1| + |z2 - z1| + \ldots
     \]
   ``

3. **Minkowski Distance:**
   - Minkowski distance is a generalized distance metric that encompasses both Euclidean and Manhattan distances. It introduces a parameter p, where p=2 corresponds to Euclidean distance, and p=1 corresponds to Manhattan distance.
   - Formula for Minkowski distance between two points, A(x1, y1, z1, ...) and B(x2, y2, z2, ...), in n-dimensional space:
   ``
     \[
     \text{Minkowski Distance} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_{2i} - x_{1i}|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
     \]
   ``
4. **Cosine Similarity (for Text or High-Dimensional Data):**
   - Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a high-dimensional space. It's commonly used for text data or other data represented as vectors.
   - Formula for cosine similarity between two vectors A and B:
   ``
     \[
     \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \cdot \|B\|}
     \]
   ``
   - Here, A⋅B represents the dot product of the vectors, and ‖A‖ and ‖B‖ represent their Euclidean norms.

5. **Hamming Distance (for Categorical Data):**
   - Hamming distance is used when dealing with categorical data or binary vectors. It measures the number of positions at which the corresponding elements are different.
   - Formula for Hamming distance between two binary vectors A and B of the same length:
   ``
     \[
     \text{Hamming Distance} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(A_i \neq B_i)
     \]
   ``
   - Here, \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) represent the binary values at position i in vectors A and B, respectively.

The choice of distance metric depends on the nature of your data and the characteristics of your problem. You may need to experiment with different distance metrics to determine which one works best for your specific use case. Additionally, for some distance metrics, you can adjust parameters (e.g., p in Minkowski distance) to fine-tune the metric to your needs.
