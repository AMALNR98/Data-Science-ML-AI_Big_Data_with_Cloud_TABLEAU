- Deep learning uses Artificial Neural Networksâ€”allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.
- Why deep learning?
  - Hand engineered features are time-consuming, brittle, and not scalable in practice.
    - Low-level Features 
    - Mid-level features
    - high-level features
- Basic Working of NN
  - Receive n-inputs
  - Multiplies each input by its weight
  - Applies activation function to the sum of results
  - outputs the result
- Activation functions
  - Controls when unit is active or inactive
  - Threshold function output 1 when input is positive and 0 otherwise
    - Relu
    - leaky Relu
    - sigmoid
- Computer vision
  - Subfield of AI focused on visual data.
  - Enable machines to see and interpret the visual world.
  - Key Tasks: Image classification, object detection, scene understanding.
  - Neural Networks. like CNN, it is central for feature extraction. 
  - Powered by Deep Learning for complex pattern extraction.
