Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and the primary distinction between the two lies in the architecture of the algorithms and the level of representation and abstraction that each approach involves.

**Machine Learning:**
1. **Representation of Data:** In traditional machine learning, feature extraction and selection are typically done manually. The algorithms then learn from these features to make predictions.
2. **Feature Engineering:** The process of selecting relevant features from the data and creating new features to enhance the performance of the model is a crucial aspect of machine learning.
3. **Algorithm Complexity:** Machine learning algorithms are often less complex than deep learning algorithms and may have a shallower structure.
4. **Applicability:** Machine learning algorithms are effective for a wide range of tasks but may require domain-specific expertise in feature engineering.

**Deep Learning:**
1. **Representation of Data:** Deep learning algorithms automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. The model learns to extract features at multiple levels of abstraction from the raw data.
2. **Feature Learning:** Deep learning systems perform feature learning automatically, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The algorithms learn relevant features directly from the data.
3. **Algorithm Complexity:** Deep learning models, often implemented as neural networks with multiple layers, are more complex than traditional machine learning models. They can automatically learn intricate patterns and representations.
4. **Applicability:** Deep learning excels in tasks where the input data is complex and high-dimensional, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing strategic games.

In summary, while both machine learning and deep learning are approaches within the broader field of artificial intelligence, the key difference lies in the representation of data and the level of abstraction that the algorithms can automatically achieve. Machine learning often requires manual feature engineering, while deep learning can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making it well-suited for tasks involving large amounts of complex data.
