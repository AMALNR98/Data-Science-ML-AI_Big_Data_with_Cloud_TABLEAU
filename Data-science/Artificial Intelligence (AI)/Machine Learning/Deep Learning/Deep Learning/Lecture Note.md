Deep learning
--
  - Subset of Machine Learning
  - Binary classification models
  - Used for Large data set
  - Used for image classification and complex data set
  - Used for Unstructured data
- Topics:
  1. ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)
  2. CNN (Convolution Neural Network)
  3. CV (Computer vision openCV)
  4. OCR ()
- Types of neural networks
  - ANN
  - CNN
  - RNN
- CNN
  - Image processing: CNN is great at understanding images and computer vision tasks
  - Spotting Patterns: They find patterns like edges and textures(convolutional layers)
  - Downsizing: They make things smaller to save time (Polling layers: - Reducing size)
  - making Sense: CNN can figure out what's in pictures
  - Transfer learning: They can learn from other smart models
