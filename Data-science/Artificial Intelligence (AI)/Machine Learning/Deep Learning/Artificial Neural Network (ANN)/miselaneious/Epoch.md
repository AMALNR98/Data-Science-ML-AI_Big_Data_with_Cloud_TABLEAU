- An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset during the training phase. 
- During each epoch, the neural network processes all training samples once, computes the loss, and updates the model's parameters (weights and biases) based on the optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent.

- Key points related to epochs in ANN training:

1. **Training Process:**
   - The training process involves iteratively presenting batches of training data to the neural network, computing the loss, and updating the model parameters.
   - One epoch consists of multiple iterations (mini-batch updates), and the number of iterations in an epoch depends on the size of the training dataset and the chosen batch size.

2. **Convergence:**
   - Training typically involves multiple epochs to allow the model to gradually converge to an optimal or near-optimal set of parameters.
   - Convergence refers to the point at which the model's performance on the training data stabilizes, and further training does not lead to significant improvement.

3. **Overfitting:**
   - Training for too many epochs may lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.
   - Techniques such as early stopping, which involves monitoring the validation performance and stopping training when it starts to degrade, can help mitigate overfitting.

4. **Underfitting:**
   - On the other hand, too few epochs may result in underfitting, where the model has not learned enough from the training data and performs poorly on both training and validation sets.

5. **Hyperparameter:**
   - The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that needs to be determined during the model training process. It depends on the complexity of the task, the size of the dataset, and other factors.

6. **Monitoring Metrics:**
   - During training, it's common to monitor metrics such as training loss, validation loss, and accuracy to assess the model's performance at different points and determine when to stop training.

Here's a simplified overview of the training process during one epoch:

1. **Forward Pass:**
   - Input samples are fed into the network, and the forward pass computes predictions.

2. **Loss Calculation:**
   - The difference between predicted and actual values is measured using a loss function.

3. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):**
   - Gradients of the loss with respect to model parameters are calculated.

4. **Parameter Update:**
   - The optimization algorithm updates the model parameters based on the calculated gradients.

5. **Repeat for All Batches:**
   - Steps 1-4 are repeated for all batches in the training dataset.

6. **Repeat for Multiple Epochs:**
   - Steps 1-5 are repeated for the desired number of epochs.

In practice, the number of epochs is a hyperparameter that is often determined through experimentation and validation performance monitoring.

- it has one back propagation and one forward propagation.
