`GridSearchCV` (Grid Search Cross-Validation) is a technique for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. It is part of the scikit-learn library in Python and is used to systematically search through a predefined set of hyperparameter values for a machine learning algorithm. The goal is to find the combination of hyperparameter values that results in the best model performance.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how `GridSearchCV` works:

1. **Hyperparameter Space Definition**: Specify a hyperparameter grid, which is a dictionary where keys are hyperparameter names, and values are lists of possible values for each hyperparameter.

2. **Model Initialization**: Choose a machine learning model and create an instance of it.

3. **GridSearchCV Setup**: Create a `GridSearchCV` object, providing the model, hyperparameter grid, and the evaluation metric (such as accuracy, precision, or others).

4. **Cross-Validation**: `GridSearchCV` performs k-fold cross-validation on different combinations of hyperparameters. It divides the training data into k subsets (folds), trains the model on k-1 folds, and validates it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold being used as the validation set exactly once.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: For each combination of hyperparameters, `GridSearchCV` trains a model using the training data and evaluates its performance using cross-validation.

6. **Best Model Selection**: After evaluating all combinations, `GridSearchCV` identifies the hyperparameters that resulted in the best model performance based on the chosen evaluation metric.

7. **Final Model Training**: Optionally, you can train the final model using the best hyperparameters on the entire training dataset.

8. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the final model's performance on a separate test dataset.

Here's a simple example using `GridSearchCV` with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the SVM model
svm_model = SVC()

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'], 'gamma': [0.1, 1, 10]}

# Create a GridSearchCV object
grid_search = GridSearchCV(svm_model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')

# Fit the model to the data
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the best hyperparameters
best_params = grid_search.best_params_

# Evaluate the best model on the test set
accuracy = grid_search.score(X_test, y_test)

print("Best Hyperparameters:", best_params)
print("Accuracy on Test Set:", accuracy)
```

In this example, we use an SVM classifier, and we search through different values of the hyperparameters 'C', 'kernel', and 'gamma'. The best hyperparameters are then used to train the final model, and its accuracy is evaluated on the test set. Adjust the parameters and model according to your specific use case.
