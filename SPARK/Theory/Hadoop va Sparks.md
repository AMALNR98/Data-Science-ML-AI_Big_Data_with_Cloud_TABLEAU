Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark are both distributed computing frameworks, but they have different purposes and characteristics. Here are some key differences between Hadoop and Spark:

1. **Processing Paradigm:**
   - **Hadoop:** Primarily designed for batch processing. It processes and stores large volumes of data in a distributed fashion using the MapReduce programming model.
   - **Spark:** Supports both batch and real-time data processing. It can process data in-memory, making it well-suited for iterative algorithms and interactive data analysis.

2. **Data Processing Speed:**
   - **Hadoop:** Generally slower compared to Spark due to its reliance on disk storage for intermediate data between map and reduce stages.
   - **Spark:** Processes data in-memory, which makes it faster than Hadoop for iterative algorithms and applications requiring low-latency processing.

3. **Ease of Use:**
   - **Hadoop:** Programming in Hadoop often involves writing complex MapReduce programs, which can be challenging for some users.
   - **Spark:** Offers higher-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, making it more user-friendly. It also includes built-in libraries for SQL, machine learning (MLlib), graph processing (GraphX), and streaming (Spark Streaming).

4. **Data Processing Model:**
   - **Hadoop:** MapReduce is the core processing model in Hadoop, which involves two stages: Map (data processing) and Reduce (aggregation).
   - **Spark:** Provides a more flexible and expressive data processing model. It supports MapReduce-like operations as well as additional operators like transformations and actions on resilient distributed datasets (RDDs).

5. **In-Memory Processing:**
   - **Hadoop:** Relies on disk storage for intermediate data, which can result in slower processing times.
   - **Spark:** Utilizes in-memory processing, reducing the need to write intermediate results to disk and improving overall performance.

6. **Use Cases:**
   - **Hadoop:** Well-suited for batch processing of large-scale data and storing vast amounts of data across distributed nodes.
   - **Spark:** Suitable for both batch processing and real-time data processing, making it versatile for various use cases, including iterative algorithms, machine learning, and interactive data analysis.

In practice, Spark is often used in conjunction with Hadoop, where Spark can run on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and complement Hadoop's capabilities with its in-memory processing and additional libraries.
