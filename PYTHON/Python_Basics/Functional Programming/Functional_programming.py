# Functional programming
#   A pure function is a function whose output value follows solely from its input values, without any observable side effects.
#   In functional programming, a program consists entirely of evaluation of pure functions.
#   Computation proceeds by nested or composed function calls, without changes to state or mutable data.


# Types
#   1. lambda
#   2. map
#   3. filter
#   4. list comprehension
