# map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)

# lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  ====> f(x)(function is square of list element) = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Syntax :
# variable_name = list(map(function,iterable))
