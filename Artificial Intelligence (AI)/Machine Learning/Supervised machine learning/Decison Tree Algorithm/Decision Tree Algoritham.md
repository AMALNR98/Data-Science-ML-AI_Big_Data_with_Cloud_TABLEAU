A Decision Tree is a non-linear supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It's a versatile and interpretable algorithm that models decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure. Here's an overview of the Decision Tree algorithm:

**For Classification:**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a labeled dataset with both independent variables (features) and the corresponding class labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data as needed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Tree Construction:**
   - The algorithm recursively selects the best feature to split the data based on a chosen criterion, such as Gini impurity, entropy, or information gain. The selected feature becomes the node, and the dataset is divided into subsets based on its values.

4. **Stopping Criteria:**
   - The algorithm stops dividing the data when one of the stopping criteria is met, which may include a maximum depth, a minimum number of samples in a leaf node, or when the data becomes pure (all instances in a node belong to the same class).

5. **Tree Pruning (Optional):**
   - After the initial tree is constructed, pruning may be applied to reduce the complexity and overfitting of the tree.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance on the test data using appropriate classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.

7. **Model Prediction:**
   - Use the trained Decision Tree model to make predictions on new or unseen data. Starting from the root node, follow the decision rules down the tree until a leaf node is reached, which corresponds to the predicted class.

**For Regression:**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset that contains both independent variables (features) and continuous target values.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Tree Construction:**
   - Similar to the classification case, the algorithm recursively selects the best feature to split the data, but it chooses the feature and split point to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) or other regression-specific criteria.

4. **Stopping Criteria:**
   - The algorithm stops splitting when one of the stopping criteria is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or containing a minimum number of samples in a leaf node.

5. **Tree Pruning (Optional):**
   - Pruning may be applied to simplify the tree and reduce overfitting.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance on the test data using regression metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

7. **Model Prediction:**
   - Use the trained Decision Tree model to make predictions on new or unseen data. Traverse the tree from the root node to a leaf node, and the predicted value is the mean of the target values in that leaf node.

Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret, making them valuable for gaining insights into the decision-making process. They are also the basis for more complex ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
