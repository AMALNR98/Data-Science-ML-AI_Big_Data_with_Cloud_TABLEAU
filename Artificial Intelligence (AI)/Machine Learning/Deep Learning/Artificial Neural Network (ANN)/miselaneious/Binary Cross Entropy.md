Binary Cross Entropy, also known as log loss or logistic loss, is a common loss function used in binary classification tasks in machine learning and neural networks. It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution (ground truth) for a binary classification problem.

For a single binary classification task, where the goal is to predict whether an instance belongs to one of two classes (usually denoted as 0 or 1), the Binary Cross Entropy loss is defined as follows:

- \[ \text{Binary Cross Entropy} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i \cdot \log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \cdot \log(1 - p_i) \right) \]
- `Binary cross entropy = 1/N sigma(1= 0 - n)  yi log(y_i^) + (1-y_i)*log(1-y_i^)`

Here:
- \( N \) is the number of instances in the dataset.
- \( y_i \) is the true label for the \( i \)-th instance (either 0 or 1).
- \( p_i \) is the predicted probability that the \( i \)-th instance belongs to class 1.

The Binary Cross Entropy loss can be broken down into two parts:
1. \( y_i \cdot \log(p_i) \): This term penalizes the model when the true label is 1 (\( y_i = 1 \)) and the predicted probability \( p_i \) is close to 0.
2. \( (1 - y_i) \cdot \log(1 - p_i) \): This term penalizes the model when the true label is 0 (\( y_i = 0 \)) and the predicted probability \( p_i \) is close to 1.

The negative sign ensures that the overall loss is minimized. The objective during training is to adjust the model parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the Binary Cross Entropy loss.

In neural network training, the backpropagation algorithm is often used to compute gradients with respect to the model parameters, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent are employed to update the parameters and minimize the loss. Binary Cross Entropy is particularly suitable for binary classification tasks and is commonly used as the loss function in the output layer of neural networks for such tasks.
