Mediapipe is a popular library developed by Google that provides a collection of pre-built tools and components for building various computer vision applications. It simplifies the development of applications that involve tasks such as face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, and more. In this response, I'll provide a basic example of how to use Mediapipe in Python for face detection. Before you start, make sure you have the `mediapipe` library installed:

```bash
pip install mediapipe
```

Now, let's create a simple Python script to perform face detection using Mediapipe:

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp

# Initialize Mediapipe Face Detection
mp_face_detection = mp.solutions.face_detection
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils

# Load the default webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Initialize Face Detection
with mp_face_detection.FaceDetection(min_detection_confidence=0.2) as face_detection:
    while cap.isOpened():
        # Read a frame from the webcam
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Flip the frame horizontally for a later selfie-view display
        frame = cv2.flip(frame, 1)

        # Convert the BGR image to RGB
        rgb_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

        # Perform face detection
        results = face_detection.process(rgb_frame)

        # Check if faces are detected
        if results.detections:
            for detection in results.detections:
                mp_drawing.draw_detection(frame, detection)

        # Display the frame
        cv2.imshow('Face Detection', frame)

        # Break the loop if 'q' key is pressed
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

# Release the webcam and close all windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This script captures video from the default webcam, performs face detection using the Mediapipe library, and displays the output with bounding boxes around detected faces. Press the 'q' key to exit the application.

You can modify this script or explore other Mediapipe modules for different computer vision tasks. Refer to the [Mediapipe documentation](https://mediapipe.dev/) for more details and examples on using different components provided by the library.
