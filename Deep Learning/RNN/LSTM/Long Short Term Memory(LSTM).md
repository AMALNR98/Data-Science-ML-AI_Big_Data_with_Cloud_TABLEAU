Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

LSTM networks are widely used in various tasks involving sequential data, such as natural language processing (NLP), time series prediction, speech recognition, and more. They are particularly effective when dealing with sequences where long-range dependencies are crucial, as they can maintain information over long time steps.

Key features of LSTM networks include:

1. **Memory Cells:**
   - LSTM networks contain special units called memory cells, which maintain a cell state (or memory) that can store information over time steps. The cell state can be updated, modified, and passed along the network through gates.

2. **Gates:**
   - LSTM networks have three types of gates that control the flow of information: forget gate, input gate, and output gate.
   - Forget Gate: Determines which information from the previous cell state should be forgotten or retained.
   - Input Gate: Determines which new information should be added to the cell state.
   - Output Gate: Determines what information from the cell state should be output to the next layer.

3. **Sigmoid and Tanh Activation Functions:**
   - LSTM networks use sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation functions to regulate the flow of information through the gates and the cell state.

4. **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):**
   - LSTM networks are trained using the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, which is a variant of backpropagation specifically designed for recurrent neural networks.

5. **Gradient Clipping:**
   - To address the exploding gradient problem in training deep LSTM networks, gradient clipping techniques are often applied, where gradients are scaled down if they exceed a certain threshold.

6. **Variants:**
   - Several variants of LSTM networks exist, including peephole LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), each with its own modifications and improvements.

LSTM networks have become a fundamental building block in many deep learning architectures for sequential data processing. They have demonstrated superior performance in various tasks and are widely adopted in both academic research and industrial applications.
