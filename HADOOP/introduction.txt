Hadoop
--------

Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large-scale data sets. It provides a reliable and scalable platform that allows for the processing of big data across clusters of computers.

At its core, Hadoop consists of two main components:

    Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): HDFS is a distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to data across multiple machines. It is designed to store large data sets across multiple nodes in a cluster, providing fault tolerance and data redundancy.

    MapReduce: MapReduce is a programming model and processing framework that allows for distributed data processing in parallel. It divides the data into smaller chunks and distributes them across the nodes in a cluster, where the processing is performed in parallel. MapReduce is responsible for managing the computation and data movement across the cluster.

Hadoop enables the processing of massive data sets by distributing the workload across a cluster of commodity hardware. It provides fault tolerance, as the data and computation are replicated across multiple nodes. Hadoop is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data efficiently.

In addition to HDFS and MapReduce, Hadoop also includes other ecosystem components such as YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which manages cluster resources, and various higher-level data processing frameworks like Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Apache Spark, and more, which provide easier abstractions and tools for data analysis and processing on top of the Hadoop platform.

Overall, Hadoop is widely used in big data analytics and is known for its ability to handle large-scale data processing tasks in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner.

Apache Pig
----------

Apache Pig is a high-level data flow scripting language and execution framework built on top of Apache Hadoop. It provides a platform for processing and analyzing large datasets in a distributed computing environment.

Pig simplifies the process of writing complex MapReduce tasks by providing a SQL-like language called Pig Latin. Pig Latin allows developers to express data transformations, manipulations, and analyses using a set of high-level operators and functions. It abstracts away the low-level details of writing MapReduce programs, making it easier for developers to work with big data.

With Apache Pig, you can perform a wide range of data processing tasks, including:

    Data Extraction: Pig allows you to load data from various sources such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, and more.

    Data Transformation: Pig provides operators like FILTER, GROUP BY, JOIN, ORDER BY, and others to transform and manipulate the data.

    Data Analysis: Pig supports user-defined functions (UDFs), which allow you to write custom functions in Java, Python, or other programming languages to perform advanced data analysis tasks.

    Data Storage: Pig supports storing processed data back into HDFS, Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, and other storage systems.
			

		Apache Cassandra:Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable and distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across multiple commodity servers,
				 providing high availability and fault tolerance. It was originally developed at Facebook and later open-sourced and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.
		Apache HBase	:Apache HBase is a distributed, column-oriented NoSQL database built on top of the Hadoop ecosystem. It provides real-time read and write access to large datasets,
				 enabling fast and scalable storage and retrieval of structured data.






Pig scripts written in Pig Latin are compiled into a series of MapReduce jobs, which are then executed on a Hadoop cluster. Pig optimizes the execution of these jobs by automatically generating the necessary MapReduce code behind the scenes.

Apache Pig is widely used in big data processing and analysis scenarios where complex data transformations and analyses are required. It provides a higher level of abstraction compared to writing MapReduce code directly, making it easier and faster to develop data processing workflows.
