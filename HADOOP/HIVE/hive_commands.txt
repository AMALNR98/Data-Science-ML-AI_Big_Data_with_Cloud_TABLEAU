1.show databases

	show databases;

2. how to create database

	create database data_base_name;

3.how to delete database

	drop database database_name;

4. select data base

	use database_name;
5.creation of table

	create table table_name(schema) row format delimited fields terminated by 'data-seperation' stored as textfile;

		here tables are imported row by row

	eg:
		create table sample1(id1 int,id2 int,id3 int,id4 int,id5 int,id6 int,id7 int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;


		create table txnfile(id bigint,date_ string,customer_id bigind,price float,category string,product string,place string,street string,payment_type string) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;

6. load data to table

	here we can load from both HDFS and local at a time

		for local
			load data local inpath 'file-path' into table table_name;
	
		for HDFS
			load data inpath 'file-path' into table table_name;

			in this the data is stored in /user/hive/warehouse
			when we load the data into hive the data in hdfs is 'moved into hive'
			so the file wiil removed from hdfs
			it's an disadvantage

			to avoid this problem


hive tables
----------------

internal tables vs external table??????

1.Internal table

	create table table_name(schema) row format delimited fields terminated by 'data-seperation' stored as text file;



2.External table
	to aviod above problem

	create external table table_name(schema) row format delimited fields terminated by 'data-seperation' stored as text file;



more HIVE queries
-----------------

1. select particular columns

	select column_names from table table_name;

	eg;
		select id1,id2,id3 from sample1;

2. filter data

	select colname form table_name where condition
	
	eg:
		select fname,lname,age from customer1 where age>30;



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					VIEW TABLE

in hive we can only process data
we can't store data in HDFS.
So we can store data in hive as table but it is not visible in HDFS, this table is known as "view table"


1. create view table
 	create view view_table_name as query;

		eg:create view chennai_data as select fname,lname,age from sample4 where location=='Chennai';


 DROP view table

        drop view view_table_name;


2.ORDER BY

	select * from table_name order by colname asc;

	eg:

		select * from sample4 order by age asc;

	we can also order string, small letters and block letters are seperatly sorted
		eg:select * from sample4 order by fname asc;
3.LIMIT operator

	select * from table_name limit number;

	eg:
		select * form sample4 limt 4;

select > count > where > order > limit

4.DISTINCT()
	for remove duplicate rows and colloect unique rows
	
	select distinct * form table_name;

		eg:select distinct * from customer1;



EVALUATING FUNCTIONS
--------------------
for perform evaluvation function we have to group dataset



1. COUNT

	1. Row count
		for row count we don't have to group data

		select count(*) from table_name;

			eg: select count(*) from customer1;


	2. Each column count
		
		select column_name, count(*) from table_name group by column_name;

			eg: select location, count(*) from sample4 group by location;

			-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			|select job, count(*) as job_count from customer1 group by job order by job_count desc;  | important example
			-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			

2. MIN

	select column_name,min(column_name) from table_name group by column_name;

		eg: select age,min(age) from customer1 group by age;
			or
		select job,min(age) from customer1 group by job;

3. MAX
	select column_name,max(column_name) from table_name group by column_name;
4. AVG
	select coulmn_name,avg(column_name) from table_name group by column_name;
5. SUM
	select column_name,sum(column_name) from table_name group by coulmn_name;


these functions are same as MySQL queries
