Sqoop jobs in Apache Sqoop are a way to define and manage recurring data transfer tasks between relational databases and Hadoop. 
Sqoop jobs simplify the process of importing or exporting data by allowing you to save the import/export configurations as reusable job definitions.

create job
	syntax :
		sqoop job --create job_name -- query

	eg:
		sqoop job --create emp_data -- import --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/luminar --table employee --username root --password Password@123 --m 1 target-dir /directory

to verify if job created
	
	syntax:
		sqoop job --list

for show jobs content

	syntax:
		sqoop job --show job -name

execute job
	
	synatax:
		sqoop job --ecex job_name

if there is any mistakes in query we should edit qurey and also edit job name
