**Heartbeat Communication:**
- DataNodes regularly communicate with the NameNode through heartbeat messages to report their status and availability.
- This communication ensures that the NameNode is aware of the active DataNodes in the cluster and their ability to store data. 
- The NameNode uses this information to determine which DataNodes can receive additional data blocks for storage.

1. A user give 960MB of data, then howmuch  Meta Blocks where created in Name Node
Ans)

		To determine the number of metadata blocks created in the NameNode when a user gives 960MB of data, 
		we need to consider the default block size in Hadoop and the size of the metadata associated with each data block.

		The default block size in Hadoop is typically set to 64MB.
		However, it's important to note that the block size can be configured to a different value based on specific requirements. 
		For the sake of this calculation, let's assume the default block size of 128MB.

		Given that the user provides 960MB of data, and the block size is 128MB, we can calculate the number of data blocks created:

		Number of data blocks = Total data size / Block size
			      = 960MB / 64MB= 15 
			      (rounded to the nearest whole number)

		Therefore, when a user provides 960MB of data, approximately 7 metadata blocks would be created in the NameNode. 
		The metadata blocks store information about the file, such as the file's attributes, permissions, and the mapping of data blocks to their respective DataNodes 
		in the cluster.

- Ans)

ans)

	This question is not valid for Hadoop
	Because in Haddoop the size of one meta block is 64MB
	So it's not possible
	
	In YEARN:
		69 * 128 + 66 =
