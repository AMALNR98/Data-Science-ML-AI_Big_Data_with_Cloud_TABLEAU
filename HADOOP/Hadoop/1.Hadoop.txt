1. Batch Data processing
------------------------
	-Batch processing refers to the execution of a series of data processing tasks on a batch of data.
	-It involves collecting a large amount of data over a period of time and processing it as a group 
	 or batch rather than processing individual data items in real-time.
	- Hadoop is used only for batch processing
	 
2. Real-time data pocessing
---------------------------
	- Real-time data processing in big data refers to the ability to process and analyze data as it is generated,
	  providing immediate insights and responses.
	- Unlike batch processing, which accumulates data over a period of time and processes it in batches,
	  real-time data processing focuses on processing data as soon as it becomes available, 
	  typically within milliseconds or seconds.
	- Spark supports real-time data processing and Batch Data porcessing

	1. Structured Data
	------------------
		- Low size
		- Ex: pdf,text
		
	2. Semi-structured Data
	-----------------------
		- Semi-structured data refers to data that does not have a rigid structure like structured data, 
		- but still has some level of organization and can be partially categorized. 
		- It falls between structured and unstructured data in terms of organization and schema.
		- Text Includes symbols
		- Ex:   1.HTML
			2.csv(comma seperated value)
			3.JSON(Java Script Object Notation)
			4.XML(Extencible Markup  Language)
			
	3. Unstructured Date
	--------------------
		- Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a predefined structure or organization. 
		- It lacks a formal data model, schema, or clear format, making it challenging to analyze using traditional data processing methods.
		- Ex : Multimedia (videos, images, songs)
