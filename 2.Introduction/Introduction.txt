-Big data
----------
	Big data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that are beyond the ability of traditional data processing applications to efficiently capture, store, manage, and analyze. 
	It typically involves datasets with a size ranging from terabytes to petabytes and even exabytes.

	The term "big data" is characterized by three key aspects, often referred to as the three V's:

	1. Volume: 
	-----------
		Big data involves a massive volume of data. 
		With the increasing digitization of various processes and the growth of technologies like IoT, social media, and sensors, data is being generated at an unprecedented rate.
		This includes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from various sources.

	2. Velocity:
	------------ 
		Big data is generated at high velocity. The speed at which data is produced, collected, and processed is a crucial characteristic of big data.
		Real-time or near-real-time data generation, streaming data, and rapidly changing data sources contribute to the velocity aspect of big data.

	3. Variety: 
	-----------
		Big data encompasses diverse data types and formats. It includes structured data (such as traditional databases), 
		semi-structured data (like log files and XML files), and unstructured data (such as text, images, audio, and video). 
		Big data can originate from sources such as social media, sensor data, customer transactions, emails, and more.

	Beyond the three V's, big data can also exhibit additional characteristics:

	4. Veracity:
	------------ 
		Veracity refers to the quality and reliability of data. 
		Big data can contain errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies, and it requires careful validation and cleansing to ensure data quality.

	5. Value: 
	---------
		Extracting value from big data is a primary objective.
		By analyzing large and diverse datasets, organizations can gain insights, make informed decisions, identify patterns and trends, and create business value. 
		The potential value that can be	derived from big data is a driving force behind its collection and analysis.

	Big data analytics involves applying advanced techniques, such as data mining, machine learning, and predictive analytics, to derive meaningful insights from large datasets.
	These insights can lead to improved operational efficiency, enhanced customer experiences, better decision-making, and new business opportunities.

	--------------
		Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves extracting knowledge, insights, and actionable information from data using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and tools.
		It combines elements of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain expertise, and problem-solving to analyze large and complex datasets and derive meaningful insights.
	
		Artificial Inteligence:
		-----------------------
			Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
			AI systems aim to simulate and replicate human cognitive abilities, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.
			
			AI utilizes various techniques and approaches, including:

    			Machine Learning:
    			-----------------
    				 Machine learning involves training AI systems on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. 
    				It includes techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

    			Deep Learning:
    			-------------	
    			 	Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training deep neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data and extract 
    			 	meaningful representations.

   				They are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks in the human brain. 
   				Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons or "nodes" or "units," organized in layers.

				The structure of a neural network typically consists of three types of layers:

    					Input Layer:
    					------------
    						 The input layer receives the initial data or features and passes them to the subsequent layers for processing.

    					Hidden Layers:
    					--------------
    						 Hidden layers are intermediate layers between the input and output layers. 
    						They perform complex computations and transformations on the input data through weighted connections between neurons.

    					Output Layer:
    					------------- 
    						The output layer provides the final output or prediction based on the computations performed by the hidden layers.

				Each connection between neurons in the neural network has an associated weight, which represents the strength or importance of that connection. 
				During the training process, these weights are adjusted to optimize the network's performance on a specific task.

				Neural networks use activation functions to introduce non-linearity into the computations. Activation functions determine the output of a neuron based on its weighted inputs. 
				Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax.

				Training a neural network involves a process called "backpropagation," where the network learns from labeled training data. 
				During backpropagation, the network adjusts the weights of its connections to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual outputs, 
				using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent.
